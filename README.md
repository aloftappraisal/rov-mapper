# ROV Mapper

[ROV Mapper](https://rovmapper.aloftappraisal.com) lets appraisers visually compare alternative comparable properties from a [Reconsideration of Value (ROV)](https://www.helpwithmybank.gov/help-topics/mortgages-home-equity/appraisals/rov.html) with their original comparables on a map.

The subject property, ROV comparables, and original comparables are placed on a map and listed using distinct pin colors, allowing for easy side-by-side comparison. Appraisers can also add custom comments to explain why their selected comparables are more appropriate than the ROV comparables. The tool creates a PDF export of the map and comments, providing a clear justification of the selected comps over the ROV comps for sharing and review.
